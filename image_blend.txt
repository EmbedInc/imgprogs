                           Program IMAGE_BLEND

image_blend <in1 fnam> <in1 weight> <in2 fnam> <in2 weight> <out fnam>
  [ options ]

Blend the IN1 and IN2 images together to produce the OUT image.  The
output image values will be clipped to the limits of the intensity range.
The two input images must be of the same size.  The output image pixel
values will be computed by the formula:

  OUT = IN1*WEIGHT1 + IN2*WEIGHT2 + ADD

The command line options are:

  -ADD <offset value>

    Add a fixed amount to the output image.  The 0.0 to 1.0 range of
    OFFSET_VALUE corresponds to the full intensity range.  The default
    OFFSET_VALUE is zero.


                                Example

Assume two image files of the same pixel size exist, called im1.img and
im2.img.  The following command will subtract im2 from im1.  The
differences will be exaggerated by a factor of ten.  The output image
value will be normalized so that 50% gray will result where the two input
images are equal.  The output image file will be created and called
diff.img.

  $ image_blend im1 10 im2 -10 diff -add .5
