                           Program IMAGE_FILTER

image_filter <input file name> <output file name> [<options> . . .]

Read the input image file and create the output image file.  The image
will be shrunk and filtered in the process.  The legal command line
options are:

  -SHRINK n

    Shrink the image by integer factor N in both dimensions.  The default
    for N is 2.

  -DSHRINK nx ny

    Shrink the image with different shrink factors for the X and Y
    dimensions.  NX and NY must be positive integers.  The default is to
    shrink the image by 2 in both dimensions.

  -FILTER filter_file_name

    Load the filter kernel funtion from a file.  The filter kernel
    function is always assumed to be radially symmetric.  The filter file
    is an ASCII file that describes the filter function value as a
    function of the radius from 0 to some maximum value.  The first
    (non-comment) line in the filter file contains one value indicating
    the maximum radius the filter function should be evaluated at.  This
    is a floating point number in terms of output image pixel sizes.
    Therefore, a value of 1.5 would cause a filter kernel that is 3x3
    output pixels in size.  The remaining lines in the file each contain a
    pair of numbers.  The first number is a radius, and the second is the
    function value at that radius.  The function will be linearly
    interpolated between adjacent points. The radius values MUST be in
    ascending order.  Blank lines, and lines that start with a star (*)
    are comment lines.  The default is a cos**2 filter with a radius of
    1.25 output pixel widths.
