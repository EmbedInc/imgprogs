                            24 October 2004

image_info <image file name>

Display information about an image.  The image file name on the command
line need not have the suffix identifying the image file type.  For
example, assuming the existance of file "test.img", the following commands
are equivalent:

  $ image_info test
  $ image_info test.img

For a discussion of the supported image file types, see the IMAGE_TYPES
documentation file.

IMAGE_INFO first lists some statistics about the image, and then displays
any comment lines, if present.  Not all image file types can contain
comment lines.  If comment lines are present, then one blank line is left
after the statistics, and all the comments are listed indented by two
spaces.
