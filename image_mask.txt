image_mask [options]

Read a full color image and produce a transparency mask of the foreground
content.  Each pixel, the input color is thresholded to decide whether it
represents background or foreground.  By default, background is written to
the output file as fully transparent, and foreground as fully opaque
white.

The command line options are:

  -IN filename
  filename

    Sets the input file name.  The image file type suffix can be omitted
    from FILENAME.  See the IMAGE_TYPES documentation file for a list of
    supported image types and their file name suffixes.  The file name
    must be enclosed in quotes or apostrophies if it contains spaces or
    any special characters.

    The first form of this option with the "-IN" keyword is the general
    form that works in all cases.  The second for is a shortcut that works
    when the file name does not match any command line option keyword.

  -OUT filename
  filename

    Like -IN except that is explicitly sets the output file name.  The
    default output file name is the generic input file name with "_wht"
    appended.  When the -BLK command line option is used, then "_blk" is
    appended instead.  The default output file format is TIF.

  -TH red grn blu

    Specifies the threshold to distinguish foreground from background.
    RED, GRN, and BLU are the red, green and blue color components of the
    threshold in 0.0 to 1.0 scale.  A color is considered foreground when
    any of its color components meets or exceeds its corresponding
    threshold.

    The default is 0.5, 0.5 0.5.

  -INV

    The sense of the threshold comparison is reversed.  A color is
    considered foreground when any of its components is less then or equal
    to its threshold.

  -BLK

    Causes foreground to be opaque black.  The default is opaque white.
    The background is always written as fully transparent.
